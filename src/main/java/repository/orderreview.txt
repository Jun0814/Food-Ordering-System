VR2,V2,5,The sushi was fresh and the presentation was beautiful. I loved the variety in the platter but the wasabi could’ve been spicier.

VR4,V2,5,Best ramen I’ve had in a while! The broth was rich and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly chewy and the pork melted in my mouth. I’ll definitely be back for more!

VR11,V2,4,The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce had just the right balance of flavors. The only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the breadsticks were a bit too salty for my taste.
VR12,V2,3,I tried the chicken sandwich and while the chicken was juicy the bun felt a little stale. The fries were crispy though and the dipping sauce was a nice touch. It was an okay meal but I expected more for the price.
